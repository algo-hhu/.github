Here you can find projects developed at the Algorithms and Data Structures Group of the Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf.

If you would like to try out some of the algorithms on small data (such as the Fair K-Means clustering or the coreset computation), you can use our Clustering Toolkit: https://clustering-toolkit.algo.hhu.de/. You can either upload your own dataset or use a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).
