Here you can find projects developed at the Algorithms and Data Structures Group of the Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf.

If you want to try out some of the algorithms on small data (such as the fair K-Means clustering or the coreset clustering), you can use our Clustering Toolkit: https://clustering-toolkit.algo.hhu.de/. You can either upload your own data set or use a data set from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).
